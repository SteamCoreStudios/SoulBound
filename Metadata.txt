## 🕹️ Game Description

SoulBound is a dark fantasy boss-battle game where the player is thrown directly into combat against a relentless foe.

You begin with three lives to defeat a single, ever-evolving boss. Unlike ordinary enemies, this boss wields the cursed power of soul absorption — every time it consumes a soul, it grows faster, stronger, and more dangerous, reversing its age and transforming into younger, deadlier forms.

The challenge lies in stopping the boss before it ascends into its final phase, a state of overwhelming power that no mortal warrior can defeat. Each life matters, and every mistake brings the boss closer to becoming unstoppable.  

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Boss Battles** — Each enemy has multiple phases and unique attack patterns.  
- **Skill-Based Combat** — Dash, dodge, and counterattack to survive intense encounters.  
- **Spell & Ability System** — Switch between spells mid-battle for adaptive strategies.  
- **Stylized Visuals** — Hand-drawn line art with high-contrast fantasy aesthetics.  
//Some of the Features are not yet been added to the game.
